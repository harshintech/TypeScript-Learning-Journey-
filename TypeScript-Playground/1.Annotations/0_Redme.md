How To Run

use first 
tsc "nameoffile".ts

this convert into ts --> js and then run js file 

then use
node "nameoffile".js


TS is only to error control language and it's advance level of javascript so basically we need to compile in js


// IMPORTANT

now when you convert ts --> js so you got simple function when in ts file you have arrow function

for this you need to change target mode es2016 --> ES6

for this use "tsc -init" then in this file change target 

then use only "tsc"
